zen-boilerplate
===============
Like HTML5 Boilerplate but for Drupal's Zen base theme. This is intended to enhance the workflow of designers designing in HTML/CSS/JS for sites that will ultimately be coded Drupal using Zen as a base theme. 

In short, this should make a smoother transition from HTML mockups to production Zen-based Drupal sites.
